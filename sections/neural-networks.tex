Goal of this section is to give brief introduction to deep learning area. In the Subsection \ref{subsection:FNN} an introduction to the basic neural networks is provided. After that, in the Subsection \ref{subsection:gradient-descent} the gradient descent algorithm is introduced and variations of it. It is used for optimization of functions based on the derivations of it. The gradient descent represents the ground idea behind the backpropagation algorithm which is introduced in the Subsection \ref{subsection:backpropagation}. The backpropagation algorithm the most popular algorithm for training neural networks. Finally, in the Section \ref{subsection:convolutionalNN} the convolutional neural networks are presented. A convolutional neural network represents a typical choice of the architecture of the neural network when it comes to the domain of computer vision.
