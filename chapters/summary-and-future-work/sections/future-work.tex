Reducing the complexity of Jacobian-based dataset augmentation would allow more people to experiment in this field without need for too expensive resources. If complexity can not be reduced, maybe another, memory cheaper, heuristic can be used for obtaining boundaries of the targeted network. Eventually, this would allow attacks from cheap computers and raise the awareness about the security of neural networks.

If the resources allow, it would be interesting to evaluate the ensemble approach on this problem. A cluster can be constructed that would train different networks which would train based on the results of the black-box network. Than an adversarial sample for all of them would probably be adversarial against the black-box network as well.

It would be interesting to evaluate the black-box attacks presented in this thesis against the real world systems for age estimation that are publicly available. Microsoft Azure \footnote{https://azure.microsoft.com} is one such system which offers age estimation service. Before the evaluation against the real system, the experiments for black-box attacks should show better results.
