As Artificial Intelligence (AI) is getting a greater impact in our everyday life, it is of utmost importance that it is safe for humans.  

One of the tools used in AI are deep neural networks (DNNs) and neural networks in general. Deep neural networks are powerful learning models that achieve excellent performance on visual recognition problems \cite{krizhevsky2012imagenet}. Those results imply that DNNs can be used in different industry domains, e.g. traffic sign recognition, a domain in which DNNs even outperform humans \cite{outperformhumans}. 

Nevertheless, neural networks tend to have some peculiar properties as well. If only several pixels in an image are changed, some neural networks produce incorrect results \cite{szegedy2013intriguing}. Such a behaviour is not desirable in safety-critical systems. For example, if an autonomous car recognizes a  \textit{STOP} sign as anything else but a \textit{STOP} sign, it can lead to deadly consequences. Therefore, it is important to verify the system.
