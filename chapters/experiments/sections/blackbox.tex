When it comes to blackbox attacks, three approaches are evaluated: Transfer based approach, Ensemble approach and Boundary attack.

In the transfer based approach, first the targeted blackbox is queried with 100 different images and MAE is computed. Then a substitute network is trained using those 100 images. However, labels for those images are obtained by querying the targeted blackbox. Then the dataset is iteratively expanded via jacobian dataset augmentation technique . Finally, the FGSM attack is used to produce adversarial samples. Results are presented in the table XY.

Regarding the ensemble approach, ???

Finally, when it comes to boundary attack, I start with the image of 50 years old and make it look as 10, 20, 30, 40, 60, 70, 80 and 90 years old. Every attack is limited to 10 000 queries. Results are presented in image XY and table XY.
