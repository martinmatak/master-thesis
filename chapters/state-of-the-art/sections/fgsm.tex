In this thesis, a targeted version \cite{fgsm-targeted} of it will be used. The target label in the paper was always a label with the least probability for an unmodified image. They evaluate their method on the ImageNet dataset \cite{datasetImageNet}, a large-image recognition task with 1000 classes. Since the goal in the paper was misclassification, results for a targeted misclassification are not presented.
