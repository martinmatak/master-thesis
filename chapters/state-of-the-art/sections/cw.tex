 According to the authors, this attack is often much more effective (and never worse) than all the others presented in the literature. 
Attacks are evaluated on three datasets: ImageNet, MNIST and CIFAR-10 \cite{datasetCIFAR10}, a small-image recognition task, also with 10 classes as in MNIST. They also report that JSMA is always failing on ImageNet dataset due to memory complexity of the algorithm, i.e. ImageNet dimensions of an image (229x229x3) are too big for JSMA. This implies that JSMA could not work in my thesis as well if an image of a person is too big. Reported results for CW attack are showing 100\% success against all three datasets.
