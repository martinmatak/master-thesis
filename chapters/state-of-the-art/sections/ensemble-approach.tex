This approach is also based on transferability of an adversarial image, but instead of generating an adversarial image for one neural network, generates it for several of them. The underlying assumption is that if an adversarial example works as expected among several models, it will work as expected for the one more as well. Both approaches will be implemented - when a substitute network is only a single neural network, and when there is several of them. I want to see if it's enough to use only one neural network as a substitute to achieve good results in semi-targeted misclassification.
